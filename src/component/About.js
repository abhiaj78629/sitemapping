        How you operate. If you offer a service, explain your business model or
        how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing things,
        show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out
        against competitors. The face of your business. Feature photos of the
        founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are
        buying from or working with. Persuasive content. Consider what step
        you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and calls to
        action to move them forward towards that goal. This could include
        buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations, links to
        blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.
